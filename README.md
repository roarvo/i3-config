# i3-config

Hi everybody

this shall be a summary of my personal `i3`, `i3bar`, `xinit` etc config files that I personally use.
If you like something you see feel free to use it, if you see something you don't, feel free to comment
and suggest changes. And never forget to have fun!

## i3blocks

`i3blocks` config is derived from http://kumarcode.com/Colorful-i3/

I use i3blocks for my i3bar so I have coloured output. For installation on Arch Linux from AUR use
```shell
  yaourt -S i3blocks.
```
For the Icons download the ttf files and copy them to
```shell
  cp *.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts
```
To reload fonts
```shell
  fc-cache -fv
```

## zsh

for the configuration of zshrc see https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
